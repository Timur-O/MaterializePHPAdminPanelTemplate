- Pre-built template for user management

## Getting Started
---
### 1. Install the dependencies
1. If you downloaded the release you can skip this step, otherwise run `composer install` once in the root directory of the template
2. To decrease amount of files in dependency go to `vendor/google/apiclient-services/src/Google/Service` and delete all files except: the Analytics and AnalyticsReporting folders and the Analytics.php and AnalyticsReporting.php files. This will decrease the amount of files from ~12,000 to ~600.

### 2. Get Google Analytics Credentials
In order for the template to work, a file needs to be present in the root of the template files. This file is called `client_secrects.json`. This file can be found by doing the following:
1. Go to this page: https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials
2. Click Create credentials and select OAuth client ID
3. For the Application type select Web application
4. Name the client ID whatever you like and click Create
5. Leave the Authorized JavaScript origins blank
6. Set the Authorized redirect URIs to http://yourdomain.tld/path/to/oauth2callback.php
7. Click Create
8. On the Credentials page click the newly created client ID, click Download JSON and save it as `client_secrets.json` in the root of the template files

### 3. Get Uptime Robot Credentials
In order to access status updates from uptime robot an API Key is needed. This can be found by doing the following:
1. Log into your uptime robot account
2. Click my settings and find where it says Read-Only API Key (Must be read-only because the key will be exposed in the Javascript)
3. Copy the API Key and paste it into the config.php file where it says `$uptimeKey`

### 4. Find your Google Analytics ViewID
1. Go to google analytics and click on Admin
2. Under view click on view settings and at the top it should say view id
3. Copy this number and in the config.php file past it where it says `$analyticsViewID` in the second quotation marks after the `ga:`. If you get an error make sure `$analyticsViewID` is equal to `ga:YOURID`

### 5. Connect to your database
1. Add your database details in the config.php file
2. Make sure the password hashes in the database are generated with `password_hash()` with PHP

### 6. Fill out the other values in the config.php file
1. Add your twitter handle - if you don't want to show a twitter feed, go to the index.php file and delete the div with the class twitterFeed.
2. Add a link to an RSS feed you want to show- if you don't want to show a RSS feed, go to the index.php file and delete the div with the class rssFeed.
3. Change the `$rootOfFiles` variable depending on the location of the admin panel files. If in the root of a domain - eg. htdocs folder, then simply leave the variable as an empty string. Otherwise add the a forward slash and the folder name - eg. if the files are in the admin folder then the variable should be `/admin`.
